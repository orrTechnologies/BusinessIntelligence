# BusinessIntelligence


The idea was it would be cool to have a dashboard, where you would see not just what people are saying about your company, but as a whole, is it positive or negative. Allowing you to identify your problem customers and reactive to them first. 

Using IBM's Watson artificial intelligence API this was possible, by searching a Facebook page, downloading its feed, and submitting it to Watson for sentiment analysis. This allowed me to classify post as either positive, negative, or neutral.
